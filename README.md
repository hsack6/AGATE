# AGATE

## Datasets
We created graph data from three datasets; [NBA](https://www.basketball-reference.com), [Reddit](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html), and [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn/citation).  
Time-evolving attributed graphs for AGATE can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LM5_fOi__hHCpRAXJjTi445tTRYhRsNY?usp=sharing).  
Unzip graph.zip and place it under [DATASET]/data/ to run it.
